Current TODO list, broken into things which are relevant for the
initramfs itself (/init et al) vs the generator.
A lot of things are/should be marked with "FIXME" in the code.

Items are ordered in priority.

INITRAMFS TODO

- allow dual stack configuration (IPv4, IPv6) for the same interface
- use info and warn prefix
- put "root=" parsing hooks in separate hook dir
- call "root=" parsing hooks after getting new rootpath from dhcp
- put mount hook in main initqueue loop / careful about resume!
- progress indication for fsck https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=827118
- probably fix "--include" https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=849338

GENERATOR TODO

- report errors on missing files in check()
- remove wait for swap devs, if no "resume=" is given on the kernel command line
- remove wait for swap devs, if the "resume" dracut module is not included (omitted)
- add presets (predefined set of modules)
- add interpreter/plugin-scripts to be sourced at the beginning or end (can use dracut-functions)
- add mechanism for module specific command line options
- pkg-config integration, to make it easy for other packages to use us.
- default module specification could use some work
- udev rule copying, as mentioned above, is a bit too hard-coded

CODE TODO

- document more functions
- make function vars local, and prefix with "_"

Future Enhancement Requests

- run ssh server to enter crypto password or perform debugging (supported by debian)
- https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=524727 - dracut + encrypted root + networking

- lsinitrd --print-cmdline
- dracut --print-cmdline error if additional arguments
- library for cmdline
