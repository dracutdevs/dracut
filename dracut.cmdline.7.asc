NAME

dracut.cmdline - dracut kernel command line options

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The root device used by the kernel is specified in the boot configuration
file on the kernel command line, as always.

The traditional _root=/dev/sda1_ style device specification is allowed, but not
encouraged. The root device should better be identified by LABEL or UUID. If a
label is used, as in _root=LABEL=<label_of_root>_ the initramfs will search all
available devices for a filesystem with the appropriate label, and mount that
device as the root filesystem. _root=UUID=<uuidnumber>_ will mount the partition
with that UUID as the root filesystem.

In the following all kernel command line parameters, which are processed by
dracut, are described.

"rd.*" parameters mentioned without "=" are boolean parameters. They can be
turned on/off by setting them to {0|1}. If the assignment with "=" is missing
"=1" is implied. For example _rd.info_ can be turned off with _rd.info=0_ or
turned on with _rd.info=1_ or _rd.info_. The last value in the kernel command
line is the value, which is honored.

Standard
~~~~~~~~
**init=**__<path to real init>__::
    specify the path to the init program to be started after the initramfs has
    finished

**root=**__<path to blockdevice>__::
    specify the block device to use as the root filesystem.
+
[listing]
.Example
--
root=/dev/sda1
root=/dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:1f.1-scsi-0:0:1:0-part1
root=/dev/disk/by-label/Root
root=LABEL=Root
root=/dev/disk/by-uuid/3f5ad593-4546-4a94-a374-bcfb68aa11f7
root=UUID=3f5ad593-4546-4a94-a374-bcfb68aa11f7
root=PARTUUID=3f5ad593-4546-4a94-a374-bcfb68aa11f7
--

**rootfstype=**__<filesystem type>__:: "auto" if not specified.
+
[listing]
.Example
--
rootfstype=ext3
--

**rootflags=**__<mount options>__::
    specify additional mount options for the root filesystem. If not set,
    _/etc/fstab_ of the real root will be parsed for special mount options and
    mounted accordingly.

**ro**::
    force mounting _/_ and _/usr_ (if it is a separate device) read-only.  If
    none of ro and rw is present, both are mounted according to _/etc/fstab_.

**rw**::
    force mounting _/_ and _/usr_ (if it is a separate device) read-write.
    See also ro option.

**rootfallback=**__<path to blockdevice>__::
    specify the block device to use as the root filesystem, if the normal root
    cannot be found. This can only be a simple block device with a simple file
    system, for which the filesystem driver is either compiled in, or added
    manually to the initramfs. This parameter can be specified multiple times.

**rd.auto** **rd.auto=1**::
    enable autoassembly of special devices like cryptoLUKS, dmraid, mdraid or
    lvm. Default is off as of dracut version >= 024.

**rd.hostonly=0**::
    removes all compiled in configuration of the host system the initramfs image
    was built on. This helps booting, if any disk layout changed, especially in
    combination with rd.auto or other parameters specifying the layout.

**rd.cmdline=ask**::
    prompts the user for additional kernel command line parameters

**rd.fstab=0**::
    do not honor special mount options for the root filesystem found in
    _/etc/fstab_ of the real root.

**resume=**__<path to resume partition>__::
    resume from a swap partition
+
[listing]
.Example
--
resume=/dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:1f.1-scsi-0:0:1:0-part1
resume=/dev/disk/by-uuid/3f5ad593-4546-4a94-a374-bcfb68aa11f7
resume=UUID=3f5ad593-4546-4a94-a374-bcfb68aa11f7
--

**rd.skipfsck**::
    skip fsck for rootfs and _/usr_.  If you're mounting _/usr_ read-only and
    the init system performs fsck before remount, you might want to use this
    option to avoid duplication.

iso-scan/filename
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mount all mountable devices and search for ISO pointed by the argument. When
the ISO is found set it up as a loop device. Device containing this ISO
image will stay mounted at /run/initramfs/isoscandev.
Using iso-scan/filename with a Fedora/Red Hat/CentOS Live iso should just work
by copying the original kernel cmdline parameters.

[listing]
.Example
--
menuentry 'Live Fedora 20' --class fedora --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os {
    set isolabel=Fedora-Live-LXDE-x86_64-20-1
    set isofile="/boot/iso/Fedora-Live-LXDE-x86_64-20-1.iso"
    loopback loop $isofile
    linux (loop)/isolinux/vmlinuz0 boot=isolinux iso-scan/filename=$isofile root=live:LABEL=$isolabel ro rd.live.image quiet rhgb
    initrd (loop)/isolinux/initrd0.img
}

Misc
~~~~
**rd.emergency=**__[reboot|poweroff|halt]__::
    specify, what action to execute in case of a critical failure. rd.shell=0 also
    be specified.

**rd.driver.blacklist=**__<drivername>__[,__<drivername>__,...]::
    do not load kernel module <drivername>. This parameter can be specified
    multiple times.

**rd.driver.pre=**__<drivername>__[,__<drivername>__,...]::
    force loading kernel module <drivername>. This parameter can be specified
    multiple times.

**rd.driver.post=**__<drivername>__[,__<drivername>__,...]::
    force loading kernel module <drivername> after all automatic loading modules
    have been loaded. This parameter can be specified multiple times.

**rd.retry=**__<seconds>__::
    specify how long dracut should retry the initqueue to configure devices.
    The default is 30 seconds. After 2/3 of the time, degraded raids are force
    started. If you have hardware, which takes a very long time to announce its
    drives, you might want to extend this value.

**rd.timeout=**__<seconds>__::
    specify how long dracut should wait for devices to appear. The
    default is '0', which means 'forever'. Note that this timeout
    should be longer than rd.retry to allow for proper configuration.

**rd.noverifyssl**::
    accept self-signed certificates for ssl downloads.

**rd.ctty=**__<terminal device>__::
   specify the controlling terminal for the console.
   This is useful, if you have multiple "console=" arguments.

**rd.shutdown.timeout.umount=**__<seconds>__::
    specify how long dracut should wait for an individual umount to finish
    during shutdown. This avoids the system from blocking when unmounting a file
    system cannot complete and waits indefinitely. Value '0' means to wait
    'forever'. The default is 90 seconds.

[[dracutkerneldebug]]
Debug
~~~~~
If you are dropped to an emergency shell, the file
_/run/initramfs/rdsosreport.txt_ is created, which can be saved to a (to be
mounted by hand) partition (usually /boot) or a USB stick. Additional debugging
info can be produced by adding **rd.debug** to the kernel command line.
_/run/initramfs/rdsosreport.txt_ contains all logs and the output of some tools.
It should be attached to any report about dracut problems.

**rd.info**::
    print informational output though "quiet" is set

**rd.shell**::
    allow dropping to a shell, if root mounting fails

**rd.debug**::
    set -x for the dracut shell.
    If systemd is active in the initramfs, all output is logged to the systemd
    journal, which you can inspect with "journalctl -ab".
    If systemd is not active, the logs are written to dmesg and
    _/run/initramfs/init.log_.
    If "quiet" is set, it also logs to the console.

**rd.memdebug=[0-5]**::
    Print memory usage info at various points, set the verbose level from 0 to 5.
+
    Higher level means more debugging output:
+
----
    0 - no output

    2 - /proc/meminfo
    3 - /proc/meminfo + /proc/slabinfo
    4 - /proc/meminfo + /proc/slabinfo + memstrack summary
        NOTE: memstrack is a memory tracing tool that tracks the total memory
              consumption, and peak memory consumption of each kernel modules
              and userspace progress during the whole initramfs runtime, report
              is genereted and the end of initramsfs run.
    5 - /proc/meminfo + /proc/slabinfo + memstrack (with top memory stacktrace)
        NOTE: memstrack (with top memory stacktrace) will print top memory
              allocation stack traces during the whole initramfs runtime.
----

**rd.break**::
    drop to a shell at the end

**rd.break=**__{cmdline|pre-udev|pre-trigger|initqueue|pre-mount|mount|pre-pivot|cleanup}__::

    The comparisons also matches, if _<luks uuid>_ is only the beginning of the
    LUKS UUID, so you don't have to specify the full UUID.
    This parameter can be specified multiple times.
    _<luks uuid>_ may be prefixed by the keyword `keysource:`, see
    _rd.luks.key_ below.

**rd.luks.allow-discards=**__<luks uuid>__::
    Allow  using  of discards (TRIM) requests for LUKS partitions with the given
    UUID. Any "luks-" of the LUKS UUID is removed before comparing to
    _<luks uuid>_. The comparisons also matches, if _<luks uuid>_ is only the
    beginning of the LUKS UUID, so you don't have to specify the full UUID.
    This parameter can be specified multiple times.

**rd.luks.timeout=**__<seconds>__::
    specify how long dracut should wait when waiting for the user to enter the
    password. This avoid blocking the boot if no password is entered. It does
    not apply to luks key. The default is '0', which means 'forever'.

crypto LUKS - key on removable device support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NB: If systemd is included in the dracut initrd, dracut's built in
removable device keying support won't work. systemd will prompt for
a password from the console even if you've supplied **rd.luks.key**.
You may be able to use standard systemd *fstab*(5) syntax to
get the same effect. If you do need **rd.luks.key** to work,
you will have to exclude the "systemd" dracut module and any modules
that depend on it. See *dracut.conf*(5) and
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=905683 for more
information.

**rd.luks.key=**_<keypath>[:<keydev>[:<luksdev>]]_::
    _<keypath>_ is the pathname of a key file, relative to the root
    of the filesystem on some device. It's REQUIRED. When
    _<keypath>_ ends with '.gpg' it's considered to be key encrypted
    symmetrically with GPG.  You will be prompted for the GPG password on
    boot. GPG support comes with the 'crypt-gpg' module, which needs to be
    added explicitly.
+
_<keydev>_ identifies the device on which the key file resides. It may
be the kernel name of the device (should start with "/dev/"), a UUID
(prefixed with "UUID=") or a label (prefix with "LABEL="). You don't
have to specify a full UUID. Just its beginning will suffice, even if
its ambiguous. All matching devices will be probed.  This parameter is
recommended, but not required. If it's not present, all block devices will
be probed, which may significantly increase boot time.
+
If _<luksdev>_ is given, the specified key will only be used for
the specified LUKS device. Possible values are the same as for
_<keydev>_. Unless you have several LUKS devices, you don't have to
specify this parameter. The simplest usage is:
+
[listing]
.Example
--
rd.luks.key=/foo/bar.key
--
+
As you see, you can skip colons in such a case.

[NOTE]
===============================
Your LUKS partition must match your key file.

dracut provides keys to cryptsetup with _-d_ (an older alias for
_--key-file_). This uses the entire binary
content of the key file as part of the secret.  If
you pipe a password into cryptsetup *without* _-d_ or _--key-file_,
it will be treated as text user input, and only characters before
the first newline will be used. Therefore, when you're creating
an encrypted partition for dracut to mount, and you pipe a key into
_cryptsetup luksFormat_,you must use _-d -_.

Here is an example for a key encrypted with GPG (warning:
_--batch-mode_ will overwrite the device without asking for
confirmation):

[listing]
--
gpg --quiet --decrypt rootkey.gpg | \
cryptsetup --batch-mode --key-file - \
           luksFormat /dev/sda47
--

If you use unencrypted key files, just use the key file pathname
instead of the standard input. For a random key with 256 bits of
entropy, you might use:

[listing]
--
head -32c /dev/urandom > rootkey.key
cryptsetup --batch-mode --key-file rootkey.key \
           luksFormat /dev/sda47
--

You can also use regular key files on an encrypted _keydev_.

Compared to using GPG encrypted keyfiles on an unencrypted
device this provides the following advantages:

- you can unlock your disk(s) using multiple passphrases
- better security by not loosing the key stretching mechanism

To use an encrypted _keydev_ you *must* ensure that it becomes
available by using the keyword `keysource`, e.g.
`rd.luks.uuid=keysource:aaaa`
_aaaa_ being the uuid of the encrypted _keydev_.

Example:

Lets assume you have three disks _A_, _B_ and _C_ with the uuids
_aaaa_, _bbbb_ and _cccc_. +
You want to unlock _A_ and _B_ using keyfile _keyfile_. +
The unlocked volumes be _A'_, _B'_ and _C'_ with the uuids
_AAAA_, _BBBB_ and _CCCC_. +
_keyfile_ is saved on _C'_ as _/keyfile_.

One luks keyslot of each _A_, _B_ and _C_ is setup with a
passphrase. +
Another luks keyslot of each _A_ and _B_ is setup with _keyfile_.

To boot this configuration you could use:
[listing]
--
rd.luks.uuid=aaaa
rd.luks.uuid=bbbb
rd.luks.uuid=keysource:cccc
rd.luks.key=/keyfile:UUID=CCCC
--
Dracut asks for the passphrase for _C_ and uses the
keyfile to unlock _A_ and _B_. +
If getting the passphrase for _C_ fails it falls back to
asking for the passphrases for _A_ and _B_.

If you want _C'_ to stay unlocked, specify a luks name for
it, e.g. `rd.luks.name=cccc=mykeys`, otherwise it gets closed
when not needed anymore.

Network
~~~~~~~

[IMPORTANT]
=====================
It is recommended to either bind an interface to a MAC with the **ifname**
argument, or to use the systemd-udevd predictable network interface names.

Predictable network interface device names based on:

- firmware/bios-provided index numbers for on-board devices
- firmware-provided pci-express hotplug slot index number
- physical/geographical location of the hardware
- the interface's MAC address

See:
http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames

Two character prefixes based on the type of interface:

en:: ethernet
wl:: wlan
ww:: wwan

Type of names:

o<index>:: on-board device index number
s<slot>[f<function>][d<dev_id>]:: hotplug slot index number
x<MAC>:: MAC address
[P<domain>]p<bus>s<slot>[f<function>][d<dev_id>]:: PCI geographical location
[P<domain>]p<bus>s<slot>[f<function>][u<port>][..][c<config>][i<interface>]:: USB port number chain

All multi-function PCI devices will carry the [f<function>] number in the
device name, including the function 0 device.

When using PCI geography, The PCI domain is only prepended when it is not 0.

For USB devices the full chain of port numbers of hubs is composed. If the
name gets longer than the maximum number of 15 characters, the name is not
exported.
The usual USB configuration == 1 and interface == 0 values are suppressed.

PCI ethernet card with firmware index "1"::
* eno1

PCI ethernet card in hotplug slot with firmware index number::
* ens1

PCI ethernet multi-function card with 2 ports::
* enp2s0f0
* enp2s0f1

PCI wlan card::
* wlp3s0

USB built-in 3G modem::
* wwp0s29u1u4i6

USB Android phone::
* enp0s29u1u2

**ip=**__{dhcp|on|any|dhcp6|auto6|either6|single-dhcp}__::
    dhcp|on|any::: get ip from dhcp server from all interfaces. If root=dhcp,
    loop sequentially through all interfaces (eth0, eth1, ...) and use the first

    single-dhcp::: Send DHCP on all available interfaces in parallel, as
    opposed to one after another. After the first DHCP response is received,
    stop DHCP on all other interfaces. This gives the fastest boot time by

Booting live images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dracut offers multiple options for live booted images:

=====================
SquashFS with read-only filesystem image::: The system will boot with a
read-only filesystem from the SquashFS and apply a writable Device-mapper
snapshot or an OverlayFS overlay mount for the read-only base filesystem.  This
method ensures a relatively fast boot and lower RAM usage. Users **must be
careful** to avoid writing too many blocks to a snapshot volume.  Once the
blocks of the snapshot overlay are exhausted, the root filesystem becomes
read-only and may cause application failures.  The snapshot overlay file is
marked 'Overflow', and a difficult recovery is required to repair and enlarge
the overlay offline.  Non-persistent overlays are sparse files in RAM that only
consume content space as required blocks are allocated.  They default to an
apparent size of 32 GiB in RAM.  The size can be adjusted with the
**rd.live.overlay.size=** kernel command line option.
+
The filesystem structure is traditionally expected to be:
+
[listing]
--
squashfs.img          |  SquashFS from LiveCD .iso
   !(mount)
   /LiveOS
       |- rootfs.img  |  Filesystem image to mount read-only
            !(mount)
            /bin      |  Live filesystem
            /boot     |
            /dev      |
            ...       |
--
+
For OverlayFS mount overlays, the filesystem structure may also be a direct
compression of the root filesystem:
+
[listing]
--
squashfs.img          |  SquashFS from LiveCD .iso
   !(mount)
   /bin               |  Live filesystem
   /boot              |
   /dev               |
   ...                |
--
+
Dracut uses one of the overlay methods of live booting by default.  No
additional command line options are required other than **root=live:<URL>** to
specify the location of your squashed filesystem.
+
- The compressed SquashFS image can be copied during boot to RAM at
`/run/initramfs/squashed.img` by using the **rd.live.ram=1** option.
- A device with a persistent overlay can be booted read-only by using the
**rd.live.overlay.readonly** option on the kernel command line.  This will
either cause a temporary, writable overlay to be stacked over a read-only
snapshot of the root filesystem or the OverlayFS mount will use an additional
lower layer with the root filesystem.
+
Uncompressed live filesystem image:::
When the live system was installed with the '--skipcompress' option of the
__livecd-iso-to-disk__ installation script for Live USB devices, the root
filesystem image, __rootfs.img__, is expanded on installation and no SquashFS
is involved during boot.
+
- If **rd.live.ram=1** is used in this situation, the full, uncompressed
root filesystem is copied during boot to `/run/initramfs/rootfs.img` in the
`/run` tmpfs.
+
- If **rd.live.overlay=none** is provided as a kernel command line option,
a writable, linear Device-mapper target is created on boot with no overlay.

Writable filesystem image:::
The system will retrieve a compressed filesystem image, extract it to
`/run/initramfs/fsimg/rootfs.img`, connect it to a loop device, create a
writable, linear Device-mapper target at `/dev/mapper/live-rw`, and mount that
as a writable volume at `/`.  More RAM is required during boot but the live
filesystem is easier to manage if it becomes full.  Users can make a filesystem
image of any size and that size will be maintained when the system boots. There
is no persistence of root filesystem changes between boots with this option.
+
The filesystem structure is expected to be:
+
[listing]
--
rootfs.tgz            |  Compressed tarball containing filesystem image
   !(unpack)
   /rootfs.img        |  Filesystem image at /run/initramfs/fsimg/
      !(mount)
      /bin            |  Live filesystem
      /boot           |
      /dev            |
      ...             |
--
+
To use this boot option, ensure that **rd.writable.fsimg=1** is in your kernel
command line and add the **root=live:<URL>** to specify the location
of your compressed filesystem image tarball or SquashFS image.
=====================

**rd.writable.fsimg=**1::
Enables writable filesystem support.  The system will boot with a fully
writable (but non-persistent) filesystem without snapshots __(see notes above
about available live boot options)__.  You can use the **rootflags** option to
set mount options for the live filesystem as well __(see documentation about
rootflags in the **Standard** section above)__.
This implies that the whole image is copied to RAM before the boot continues.
+
NOTE: There must be enough free RAM available to hold the complete image.
+
This method is very suitable for diskless boots.

**root=**live:__<url>__::
Boots a live image retrieved from __<url>__.  Requires the dracut 'livenet'
module.  Valid handlers: __http, https, ftp, torrent, tftp__.
+
[listing]
.Examples
--
root=live:http://example.com/liveboot.img
root=live:ftp://ftp.example.com/liveboot.img
root=live:torrent://example.com/liveboot.img.torrent
--

**rd.live.debug=**1::
Enables debug output from the live boot process.

**rd.live.dir=**__<path>__::
Specifies the directory within the boot device where the squashfs.img or
rootfs.img can be found.  By default, this is `/LiveOS`.

**rd.live.squashimg=**__<filename of SquashFS image>__::
Specifies the filename for a SquashFS image of the root filesystem.
By default, this is __squashfs.img__.

**rd.live.ram=**1::
Copy the complete image to RAM and use this for booting. This is useful
when the image resides on, e.g., a DVD which needs to be ejected later on.

**rd.live.overlay={**__<devspec>__[:__{<pathspec>|auto}__]|__none__}::
Manage the usage of a permanent overlay.
+
--
* _<devspec>_ specifies the path to a device with a mountable filesystem.
* _<pathspec>_ is the path to a file within that filesystem, which shall be
used to persist the changes made to the device specified by the
**root=live:__<url>__** option.
+
The default _pathspec_, when _auto_ or no _:<pathspec>_ is given, is
`/<rd.live.dir>/overlay-<label>-<uuid>`, where _<label>_ is the
device LABEL, and _<uuid>_ is the device UUID.
* _none_ (the word itself) specifies that no overlay will be used, such as when
an uncompressed, writable live root filesystem is available.
+
If a persistent overlay __is detected__ at the standard LiveOS path, the
overlay & overlay type detected, whether Device-mapper or OverlayFS, will be
used.
--
+
[listing]
.Examples
--
rd.live.overlay=/dev/sdb1:persistent-overlay.img
rd.live.overlay=UUID=99440c1f-8daa-41bf-b965-b7240a8996f4
--

**rd.live.overlay.size=**__<size_MiB>__::
Specifies a non-persistent Device-mapper overlay size in MiB.  The default is
_32768_.

**rd.live.overlay.readonly=**1::
This is used to boot with a normally read-write persistent overlay in a
read-only mode.  With this option, either an additional, non-persistent,
writable snapshot overlay will be stacked over a read-only snapshot,
`/dev/mapper/live‑ro`, of the base filesystem with the persistent overlay, or a
read-only loop device, in the case of a writable __rootfs.img__, or an OverlayFS
mount will use the persistent overlay directory linked at `/run/overlayfs‑r` as
an additional lower layer along with the base root filesystem and apply a
transient, writable upper directory overlay, in order to complete the booted
root filesystem.

**rd.live.overlay.reset=**1::
Specifies that a persistent overlay should be reset on boot.  All previous root
filesystem changes are vacated by this action.

**rd.live.overlay.thin=**1::
Enables the usage of thin snapshots instead of classic dm snapshots.
The advantage of thin snapshots is that they support discards, and will free
blocks that are not claimed by the filesystem. In this use case, this means
that memory is given back to the kernel when the filesystem does not claim it
anymore.

**rd.live.overlay.overlayfs=**1::
Enables the use of the *OverlayFS* kernel module, if available, to provide a
copy-on-write union directory for the root filesystem.  OverlayFS overlays are
directories of the files that have changed on the read-only base (lower)
filesystem.  The root filesystem is provided through a special overlay type
mount that merges the lower and upper directories.  If an OverlayFS upper
directory is not present on the boot device, a tmpfs directory will be created
at `/run/overlayfs` to provide temporary storage.  Persistent storage can be
provided on vfat or msdos formatted devices by supplying the OverlayFS upper
directory within an embedded filesystem that supports the creation of trusted.*
extended attributes and provides a valid d_type in readdir responses, such as
with ext4 and xfs.  On non-vfat-formatted devices, a persistent OverlayFS
overlay can extend the available root filesystem storage up to the capacity of
the LiveOS disk device.
+
If a persistent overlay is detected at the standard LiveOS path, the overlay &
overlay type detected, whether OverlayFS or Device-mapper, will be used.
+
The **rd.live.overlay.readonly** option, which allows a persistent overlayfs to
be mounted read-only through a higher level transient overlay directory, has
been implemented through the multiple lower layers feature of OverlayFS.

Configuration in the Initramfs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
_/etc/conf.d/_::

    set initial values. Command line options will override these values
    set in the configuration files.

_/etc/cmdline_::
    Can contain additional command line options. Deprecated, better use
    /etc/cmdline.d/*.conf.

_/etc/cmdline.d/*.conf_::
