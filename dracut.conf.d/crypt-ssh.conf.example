# NOTE: The defaults in this file MUST be carefully read and understood before using this module!
# The defaults may NOT be appropriate for your site.  Carefully review and understand your threat model
#  (ie, what attack scenarios you are protecting yourself against) and adjust accordingly!
#

# The port to run the ssh daemon on
# Default: 222
# dropbear_port="222"

# Where to get the RSA and/or ECDSA keys for dropbear, options are:
#  GENERATE: generate a new one for each initrd run, the public key will be printed during the dracut build process
#            and on boot
#  SYSTEM:   use (convert) the host key from the host system's SSH daemon. This will make the initrd ssh indistinguishable
#            from the running system - this may be a security risk, depending on your threat model, but simplifies
#            your client-side ssh configuration
#  /path/to/openssh_key:   an absolute path to a host key, in openssh format. A public key with '.pub' ending should be present too
# 
# It is recommend that you use the system one, or supply your own.  If using the system key, be aware that an attacker
# that can access your initrd could use the host key to impersonate the running system.  This could allow them to attempt
# an MITM attack.
#
# Default: GENERATE
# dropbear_rsa_key="GENERATE"
# dropbear_ecdsa_key="GENERATE"

# Location of the list of authorized public keys that can log into the initrd ssh daemon
# Defaults to the authorized_keys list for root.  It may be advantageous to use a different authorized_keys list
#  so that users/machines that can unlock the machine are not necessarily given full root access after boot.
#  Note that root access to the initrd does give an attacker means to provide themselves with root access after boot,
#  especially if they hold the encryption keys to the root drive - choose carefully!
#
# Default: /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
# dropbear_acl="/root/.ssh/authorized_keys"
