dracut-002
==========

- new /initqueue-finished to check if the main loop can be left
- copy mdadm.conf if --mdadmconf set or mdadmconf in dracut.conf
- plymouth: use plymouth-populate-initrd
- add add_drivers for dracut and dracut.conf
- add modprobe scsi_wait_scan to be sure everything was scanned
- fix for several problems with md raid containers
- fix for selinux policy loading
- fix for mdraid for IMSM
- fix for bug, which prevents installing 61-persistent-storage.rules (bug #520109)
- fix for missing grep for md

dracut-001
==========
- better --hostonly checks
- better lvm/mdraid/dmraid handling
- fcoe booting support
    Supported cmdline formats:
    fcoe=<networkdevice>:<dcb|nodcb>
    fcoe=<macaddress>:<dcb|nodcb>
    
    Note currently only nodcb is supported, the dcb option is reserved for
    future use.
    
    Note letters in the macaddress must be lowercase!
    
    Examples:
    fcoe=eth0:nodcb
    fcoe=4A:3F:4C:04:F8:D7:nodcb

- Syslog support for dracut   
    This module provides syslog functionality in the initrd.
    This is especially interesting when complex configuration being
    used to provide access to the device the rootfs resides on.


dracut-0.9
==========
- let plymouth attach to the terminal (nice text output now)
- new kernel command line parameter "rdinfo" show dracut output, even when
  "quiet" is specified
- rd_LUKS_UUID is now handled correctly
- dracut-gencmdline: rd_LUKS_UUID and rd_MD_UUID is now correctly generated
- now generates initrd-generic with around 15MB
- smaller bugfixes

dracut-0.8
==========
- iSCSI with username and password
- support for live images (dmsquashed live images)
- iscsi_firmware fixes
- smaller images
- bugfixes

dracut-0.7
==========
- dracut:     strip binaries in initramfs
    
           --strip
                  strip binaries in the initramfs (default)
    
           --nostrip
                  do not strip binaries in the initramfs
- dracut-catimages
    
    Usage: ./dracut-catimages [OPTION]... <initramfs> <base image>
    [<image>...]
    Creates initial ramdisk image by concatenating several images from the
    command
    line and /boot/dracut/
    
      -f, --force           Overwrite existing initramfs file.
      -i, --imagedir        Directory with additional images to add
                            (default: /boot/dracut/)
      -o, --overlaydir      Overlay directory, which contains files that
                            will be used to create an additional image
      --nooverlay           Do not use the overlay directory
      --noimagedir          Do not use the additional image directory
      -h, --help            This message
      --debug               Output debug information of the build process
      -v, --verbose         Verbose output during the build process

- s390 dasd support

dracut-0.6
==========
- dracut: add --kernel-only and --no-kernel arguments
    
           --kernel-only
                  only install kernel drivers and firmware files
    
           --no-kernel
                  do not install kernel drivers and firmware files
    
    All kernel module related install commands moved from "install"
    to "installkernel".
    
    For "--kernel-only" all installkernel scripts of the specified
    modules are used, regardless of any checks, so that all modules
    which might be needed by any dracut generic image are in.
    
    The basic idea is to create two images. One image with the kernel
    modules and one without. So if the kernel changes, you only have
    to replace one image.
    
    Grub and the kernel can handle multiple images, so grub entry can
    look like this:
    
    title Fedora (2.6.29.5-191.fc11.i586)
            root (hd0,0)
            kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.29.5-191.fc11.i586 ro rhgb quiet
            initrd /initrd-20090722.img /initrd-kernel-2.6.29.5-191.fc11.i586.img /initrd-config.img
    
    initrd-20090722.img
      the image provided by the initrd rpm
      one old backup version is kept like with the kernel
    
    initrd-kernel-2.6.29.5-191.fc11.i586.img
      the image provided by the kernel rpm
    
    initrd-config.img
      optional image with local configuration files

- dracut: add --kmoddir directory, where to look for kernel modules
    
           -k, --kmoddir [DIR]
                  specify the directory, where to look for kernel modules



dracut-0.5
==========
- more generic (all plymouth modules, all keyboards, all console fonts)
- more kernel command line parameters (see also man dracut(8))
- a helper tool, which generates the kernel command line (dracut-gencmdline)
- bridged network boot
- a lot of new command line parameter

dracut-0.4
==========
- bugfixes
- firmware loading support
- new internal queue (initqueue)
    initqueue now loops until /dev/root exists or root is mounted
    
    init now has the following points to inject scripts:
    
    /cmdline/*.sh
       scripts for command line parsing
    
    /pre-udev/*.sh
       scripts to run before udev is started
    
    /pre-trigger/*.sh
       scripts to run before the main udev trigger is pulled
    
    /initqueue/*.sh
       runs in parallel to the udev trigger
       Udev events can add scripts here with /sbin/initqueue.
       If /sbin/initqueue is called with the "--onetime" option, the script
       will be removed after it was run.
       If /initqueue/work is created and udev >= 143 then this loop can
       process the jobs in parallel to the udevtrigger.
       If the udev queue is empty and no root device is found or no root
       filesystem was mounted, the user will be dropped to a shell after
       a timeout.
       Scripts can remove themselves from the initqueue by "rm $job".
    
    /pre-mount/*.sh
       scripts to run before the root filesystem is mounted
       NFS is an exception, because it has no device node to be created
       and mounts in the udev events
    
    /mount/*.sh
       scripts to mount the root filesystem
       NFS is an exception, because it has no device node to be created
       and mounts in the udev events
       If the udev queue is empty and no root device is found or no root
       filesystem was mounted, the user will be dropped to a shell after
       a timeout.
    
    /pre-pivot/*.sh
       scripts to run before the real init is executed and the initramfs
       disappears
       All processes started before should be killed here.
    
    The behaviour of the dmraid module demonstrates how to use the new
    mechanism. If it detects a device which is part of a raidmember from a
    udev rule, it installs a job to scan for dmraid devices, if the udev
    queue is empty. After a scan, it removes itsself from the queue.
