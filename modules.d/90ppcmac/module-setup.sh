# This module attempts to properly deal with thermal behavior on PowerPC
# based Mac systems, by installing the model-appropriate (when hostonly)
# or all (when not) fan control/thermal kernel modules and loading them
# in a hook.
#
# While this is not strictly necessary for all kernels, particularly
# modular kernels will not autoload those drivers, even once the full
# system is up, which results in the fans spinning up to 100%; this is
# particularly annoying on live systems, where the system takes a while
# to load, so it's best to load the drivers early in initramfs stage.
#
# The behavior of this is inspired by the thermal hook in Debian's
# initramfs-tools, but written for dracut specifically and updated
# for modern kernels (2012+).
