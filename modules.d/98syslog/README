Syslog support for dracut

This module provides syslog functionality in the initrd.
This is especially interesting when complex configuration being
used to provide access to the device the rootfs resides on.

When this module is installed into the ramfs it is triggered by
the udev event from the nic being setup (online).

Then if syslog is configured it is started and will forward all
kernel messages to the given syslog server.

The syslog implementation is detected automatically by finding the
appropriate binary with the following order:
rsyslogd
syslogd
syslog-ng
Then if detected the syslog.conf is generated and syslog is started.

Bootparameters:
syslogserver=ip    Where to syslog to
sysloglevel=level  What level has to be logged
syslogtype=rsyslog|syslog|syslogng
                   Don't auto detect syslog but set it
